        "comment": "The main difference between BCC-CSM1-1-M and BCC-CSM1-1 is their horizontal resolutions of the atmospheric component and the corresponding mask of sea-land. Future projection (2006-2100) forced with prescribed concentration scenario of RCP4.5. The carbon cycle in land and ocean component model is considered, but the time-evolution of CO2 concentration in atmospheric component is prescribed. The directions of variables uo and vo are transfered from the native tripolar grid directions to geographical eastward and northward, respectively. This ocean model is a Boussinesq model, and the sea level(zos) is obtained from the model results directly. The variable zosga(global average sea level change) is sum of steric effect(zossga) and the model global mean sea level. The reference for zos was taken with respect to the model at the start time of the experiment.",
